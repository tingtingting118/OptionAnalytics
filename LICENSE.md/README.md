Hedging by using different option strategy



Background:
TSLA is currently priced S = $330 and you wish to price 45 DTE calls and puts for strikes from $330
to $340, increment by $5. Currently have sigma(volatility)  = 35% and r = 2%.



Part 1 
Using the information from the example above construct a short put butter
y with K = 325=330=335.
(a) Is the option premium a debit or credit?
(b) Profit/Loss (P/L) for 25, 15 and 0 DTE
(c) Delta for 25 and 15 DTE (can't compute Delta with DTE = 0)
(d) P/L for 25 DTE assuming sigma1 = 25% and sigma2 = 45%
(e) For what range of prices does the prot increase with rising stock prices and what
range of prices does the prot increase with falling stock prices with 15 DTE?
(f) At 25 DTE how does falling volatility impact prot and how does rising volatility
impact profit?


Part 2 
Construct a short K = 325/335 strangle.
(a) Is the option premium a debit or credit?
The cost of trade is -27.56, which is a credit.
(b) Profit/Loss (P/L) for 25, 15 and 0 DTE
(c) Delta for 25 and 15 DTE (can't compute Delta with DTE = 0)
(d) P/L for 25 DTE assuming sigma1 = 25% and sigma2 = 45%


Part 3
3. Construct a short K = 320=325=335=340 iron condor.
(a) Is the option premium a debit or credit?
(b) Profit/Loss (P/L) for 25, 15 and 0 DTE
(c) Delta for 25 and 15 DTE (can't compute Delta with DTE = 0)
(d) P/L for 25 DTE assuming sigma1 = 25% and sigma2 = 45%
